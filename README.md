# BombCrack
A cracker for the `bomber.py` obfuscated Python script from TheSpeedX/TBomb (also check issue [#22](https://github.com/TheSpeedX/TBomb/issues/22).)

# Usage
Just a few commands and you get somewhat cracked (script is mostly `eval` and twice compressed - with `zlib` and `lzma` respectively.)

## Requirements
You'll need `autopep8` for cracked source beautifying
(you can install it with `pip`- see instructions below),
`git` and `make`, which you will have to install manually with your system package manager (these packages are usually shipped in base development sets such as ArchLinux's `base-devel`.)

## Instructions
_So, how do I shoot web?_
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DarkestEntropy/BombCrack.git
$ cd BombCrack
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # Note - you may possibly need to run this as root or append --user flag
$ make clean crack prettify # Prettifying may take some time. If you don't want it - remove 'prettify' target
```

There you go, a cracked TBomb is at your hand (just next to the Makefile, named `bomber.py.cracked` - try running it with Python - you'll see it's fully functional).

Makefile `crack` target clones TheSpeedX/TBomb repository, however, in case its attempt will fail - darkestentropy/TBomb (my mirror repository of TheSpeedX/TBomb) will be cloned instead.
